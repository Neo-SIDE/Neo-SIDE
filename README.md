# Neo-SIDE

Neo Smart IDE, or SIDE. this is an IDE that is supposed to be simple yet effective IDE. hopefully one day
it will be "the Blender of IDEs"

please note that this is still a WIP (Work In Progress), do not expect the program to have many features. Itisn't even in a beta state
so I will put it here
**this program is not even in 1.0 BETA, do not expect much from it yet**

# IU Credit

a lot of" the UI design in this program is very directly based off of the program "blender". while I didn't take any code from
the program, I did try to replicate it's look and overall feel. but don't get me wrong, I'm not right now saying _I stole the UI
design_, no I just love the program blender and use it on a daily basis, and wanted this program to feel like blender, so any similarities
are intentional, and I give all of the overall UI design credit to blender. (although I, and anyone that helped with making this program
have coded the ui itself)

# other credits

for any other credits go to the "credits.md" file. (it currently doesn't exist as there is nothing else to credit as of now)

also yes, this program is open source, anyone that changes anything can ask to have it in the main program, and if I add it I'll
credit you by username on github, followed by what you have added.
